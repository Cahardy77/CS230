Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The Gaming Room wants an application called draw it or lose it. This game will be similar to Win, Lose, or draw. This is where the teams have to guess what is being drawn.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I think the code has good comments on what each function does. I also think the software design template provides great information on what recommendations there are as well as how the application should be designed.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
I think working on a project with the idea that you are working with a team to develop it helps set you up for real world situations. You are unlikely to have to develop an application like this on your own, but with a team that each contributes their specialties to create a functional game.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would love to learn more about web based development and how the backend databases communicate with each of the game instances.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
Use cases and user stories are a great way to interpret how an application or game should behave. It is important to know how the user will be using the application so that we can correctly develop something the user and the client want.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
I used user stories as well as research to begin development. Before any software development, you need an understanding of that programming language and the specific strengths and weaknesses of it. I think more research is needed to complete and finalize the design, but it is a great start to this application!
